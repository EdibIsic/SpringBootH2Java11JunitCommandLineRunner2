Unit Tests
 Take the path to logfile.txt as an input argument
 Parse the contents of logfile.txt
 Flag any long events that take longer than 4ms

 Event id
 Event duration
 Type and Host if applicable
 Alert (true if the event took longer than 4ms, otherwise false)
Additional points will be granted for:
 Proper use of info and debug logging
 Proper use of Object Oriented programming
 Comprehensive unit test coverage
 Efficient processing of data
 Program that can handle very large files (gigabytes)
 Error handling
